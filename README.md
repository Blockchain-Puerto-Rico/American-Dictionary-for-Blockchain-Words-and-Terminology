Multilingual Blockchain Glossary of Words and Terminology üìï
=======
This repository serves as the home for our open source literary project set on officializing a multi-lingual list of terms related to Blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, etc., comprehensive enough to be useful in various contexts, from educational ones to legal matters. This serves a dual purpose of also supporting our project of submitting the first open source-collaborated Blockchain/crypto-focused bill to be submitted to Puerto Rico legislature ([repo link](https://github.com/Blockchain-Puerto-Rico/Judicial-Recognition-of-Citizen-Rights-over-Certain-Types-of-Digital-Assets))!
