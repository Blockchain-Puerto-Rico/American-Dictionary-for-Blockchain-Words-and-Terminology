## A

### Account
An object containing an address, balance, nonce, and optional storage and code. An account can be a contract account or an externally owned account (EOA)
[https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/]

### Address
Most generally, this represents an EOA or contract that can receive (destination address) or send (source address) transactions on the blockchain. More specifically, it is the rightmost 160 bits of a Keccak hash of an ECDSA public key.

## B

### Block
A collection of required information (a block header) about the comprised transactions, and a set of other block headers known as ommers. Blocks are added to the Ethereum network by miners.
[https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/]

### Blockchain
In Ethereum, a sequence of blocks validated by the proof-of-work system, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block. There is no block size limit; it instead uses varying gas limits.
[https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/]

## C

### Consensus
When numerous nodes (usually most nodes on the network) all have the same blocks in their locally validated best blockchain. 
[https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/]

### Contract Account
An account containing code that executes whenever it receives a transaction from another account (EOA or contract).
[https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/]

### Contract Creation Transaction
A special Transaction with the zero address as the recipient, that is used to register a contract and record it on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Crosslink *
A crosslink provides a summary of a shard's state. It's how shard chains will communicate with one another via the Beacon Chain in the sharded proof-of-stak system.

## D

### Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)	*
A company or other organization that operates without hierarchical management. 
[https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/]

### Dapp
Decentralized application. At a minimum, it is a smart contract and a web user interface. More broadly, a Dapp is a web application that is built on top of open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services. In addition, many Dapps include decentralized storage and/or a message protocol and platform.

### Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
A type of dapp that lets you swap tokens with peers on the network. You need ether to use one (to pay transactions fees) but they are not subject to geographical restrictions like centralized exchanges â€“ anyone can participate.
[https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/]

### Decentralized Finance
A broad category of Dapps aiming to provide financial services backed by the blockchain, without any intermediaries, so anyone with an internet connection can participate.
[https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/]

### Difficulty
A network-wide setting tat controls how much computation is required to produce a proof-of-work.
[https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/]

###Difficulty Bomb *
Planned exponential increase in proof-of-work difficulty setting designed to motivate the transition to proof-of-stake, reducing the changes of a fork.
