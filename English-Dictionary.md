### Aave token
The AAVE token is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 asset used as the governance token of the Aave blockchain protocol. AAVE token holders have the ability to propose changes and vote to approve or deny new proposals to the Aave protocol. With significant enough distribution, AAVE tokens are intended to eventually accommodate the autonomous and decentralized governance of the Aave platform.

### Apy
Annual Percentage Yield, a time-based measurement of the Return On Investment (ROI) on an asset. For example, $100 invested at 2% APY would yield $102 after one year, if there is no compounding of any interest earned on that $100 through the year. Assuming a static APY rate, the Monthly ROI would be 0.16%, in this case.

### Aave
Aave is an open-source and non-custodial lending protocol enabling the creation of money markets.
Users can earn interest on deposits and also borrow assets. Aave provides depositors a Liquidity Token that represents an equivalent derivative deposit in an identical asset.
For example, a user can deposit DAI and receive aDAI, which is a type of USD-based crypto derivative that essentially represents the value of the underlying DAI asset plus the interest gains from allowing the borrowing of one's DAI. That aDAI, could then also be used to implement further strategies to potentially amplify their gains even further.

Aave is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform on Ethereum. Aave users can take out loans by providing collateral in the form of crypto assets. Lenders who provide collateral to Aave receive aTokens in return, which automatically pay interest to the holder with funds earned from platform trading fees. Aave has pioneered the technology of ‘flash loans,’ which allow for the uncollateralized lending of funds, so long as the principal is repaid within the same Ethereum transaction block.

### Account
Account is a synonym for the usual term wallet and can be described as a private account owned by a Monero user.

An account contains all of the Monero transactions  that have been sent and received. The account balance is a sum of all the XMR received, less the XMR sent. Every Monero account has two balances: a locked and an unlocked. The unlocked balance contains funds that can be spent immediately, and the locked balance contains funds that can not be spent at the moment. You may receive a transaction that has an unlock time set, or you may have sent some Monero and are waiting for the change to come back to your wallet, both situations that could lead to those funds being locked for a time.

A key difference between traditional electronic currency and Monero is that your account resides only under your control, normally on your computer, and cannot be accessed by anyone else if you practice good security.

### Account abstraction layer (aal)
The Account Abstraction Layer (AAL) is the technical infrastructure that makes smart contract development possible on the Qtum blockchain. The foundational layer of Qtum follows the UTXO model used on blockchains such as Bitcoin. The AAL on Qtum allows the accounts model used on Ethereum to be “abstracted” or transferred in order to work on top of the UTXO model. Qtum’s AAL is the computing go-between that allows the UTXO and accounts models to interact.

### Account model
The account model is a blockchain architecture that features direct information and value transfer. Smart contract platforms such as Ethereum use the account model as opposed to the UTXO model used by the Bitcoin network, which limits the capabilities of smart contracts. One potential downside of the account model architecture is difficulty in scaling transactions-per-second.

When you send Monero to someone you only need one piece of information, and that is their Monero address. A raw Monero address is a set of 95 characters starting with a 4. The Monero donation address, for instance, is 46BeWrHpwXmHDpDEUmZBWZfoQpdc6HaERCNmx1pEYL2rAcuwufPN9rXHHtyUA4QVy66qeFQkn6sfK8aHYjA3jk3o1Bv16em.

Because those addresses are long and complex you will often encounter an OpenAlias address instead. For example, Monero donations can be sent to donate@getmonero.org or donate.getmonero.org

If you would like to get an OpenAlias address of your own then there is some information on the OpenAlias page.

### Block
A block is a container of transactions, with a new block being added to the blockchain once every 60 seconds, on average.

Blocks also contain a special type of transaction, the coinbase transaction, which add newly created Monero to the network.

Blocks are created through the process of mining, and the node that successfully mines the block then broadcasts it to each of the nodes connected to it, who subsequently re-broadcast the block until the entire Monero network has received it.

Fake or bad blocks generally cannot be created, as nodes that receive blocks always verify the transactions they contain against a set of consensus rules that all nodes adhere to, including validating the cryptographic signatures on each transaction.

On a blockchain, a block is the data record of all transaction information made during a specific timeframe on its network. Blocks are added sequentially to a network's chain of data, which in turn make up the public ledger known as blockchain. For example: A Bitcoin block contains information about the date, time, and amount of transactions, as well as signature information regarding the origin and destination of the transfer. Blocks must be confirmed by the network via a process of consensus before a chain can continue transacting and creating new blocks.

### Compound interest
Once called the eighth wonder of the world by Einstein, compound interest allows greater interest rates and returns on investments by allowing interest gained to be automatically reinvested back in with the original deposits and accrued interest. This reinvestment period is based on the planned distribution of this interest which may be hourly, weekly, monthly, or an annual interest distribution.
With compound interest, the greatest gains are often seen over a certain period in time, with a notably sharp rise in the value of investments seen at longer periods. In general, the longer a deposit benefits from compound interest, the much greater the overall gains when compared to gains made from simple interest.

### Computational backlog
Computational backlog (or debt) is defined as a set of calculations that must be completed to bring a backlog on the EOSIO blockchain up to date. Computational backlog occurs when a computer system or a blockchain network accumulates too much computational debt. This is a highly undesirable situation for a blockchain, because it can result in deteriorating system performance, including significant transaction time delays. Computational backlog must be managed efficiently to maintain the long-term health of the network. To help prevent computational backlog from happening, EOSIO block producers publish the network's available capacity for computation, state, and bandwidth.

Confirmation means that a transaction has been processed by the network and is highly unlikely to be reversed. Transactions receive a confirmation when they are included in a block and for each subsequent block. Even a single confirmation can be considered secure for low value transactions, although for larger amounts like $1000 USD, it makes sense to wait for 6 confirmations or more. Each confirmation exponentially decreases the risk of a reversed transaction.

### Crypto-collateralized loan
Crypto-collateralized loans are a type of loan where the issuer takes an cryptocurrency deposit as collateral to issue a loan in another cryptocurrency or fiat currency. The borrower must typically deposit a higher amount of initial cryptocurrency to provide a buffer against the market volatility common to digital assets. These types of loans are designed so that a borrower can access fiat liquidity while still maintaining ownership of their digital assets in order to avoid taxable events (such as a sale) or missing out on market appreciation. Since these loans are collateralized (often overly so), they are commonly processed extremely quickly (sometimes in minutes) without the need for traditional credit checks.

### Dai
DAI is an ERC-20 stablecoin token released by the Ethereum-based MakerDAO protocol that is used to facilitate collateral-backed loans without an intermediary. DAI is pegged to the US dollar in a 1:1 ratio so that each DAI should always be worth $1 USD. DAI is a decentralized crypto-backed stablecoin, and thus maintains its USD peg by using collateral in the form of cryptocurrencies like ETH.

For blockchain networks and dApps, decentralized governance refers to the processes through which the disintermediated, equitable management of a platform is executed. It involves different methodologies for voting on platform tech, strategy, updates, and rules. Blockchain governance is typically conducted using two distinct systems: on-chain governance and off-chain governance. On-chain governance relies upon blockchain-based systems, typically using automatic cryptographic algorithms through the network’s computational architecture and underlying consensus mechanism. Off-chain governance refers to decision making that is not codified on the blockchain, often on online forums or face-to-face.

A decentralized system is a conglomerate of connected, but separate entities that communicate with one another without a central authority or server. They stand in contrast to centralized systems, which feature a central point of governance. Blockchains are an example of a decentralized system: the data ledger of a blockchain is distributed amongst all the decentralized network participants (nodes), which must achieve consensus on the content of the data for the network to function. Without a single point of authority, decentralized systems like blockchains also lack a single point of failure, which means that a single damaged node cannot incapacitate the blockchain as a whole.

In contrast to PoS, where nodes are usually awarded the ability to process new blocks based solely on the total amount each node stakes, the DPoS system allows users to delegate their own stake to a node of their choosing — known as a delegate — and vote for the nodes to earn block validation access. Elected validators receive block rewards after verifying the transactions in a block, and those rewards are then shared with users who delegated them as validators.

### Derivative
In investing, a derivative is an investment instrument or tool that is based on an underlying asset or assets. Investopedia describes it thus:
Derivatives can be used to hedge a position, speculate on the directional movement of an underlying asset, or give leverage to holdings. Their value comes from the fluctuations of the values of the underlying asset. Originally, derivatives were used to ensure balanced exchange rates for goods traded internationally.
In DeFi, since 2020 there now exists a crypto derivative that is a new type of investment or asset class. This crypto derivative is a representation of an underlying digital base asset such as Ethereum, Dai, Curve, or YFI. Examples of their respective derivatives are yETH, aDAI, yCRV, and yYFI.

Diversification refers to keeping a diverse investment portfolio of assets to protect against market turmoil. Different investments tend to perform differently depending on what’s happening in the market, so owning a variety of diverse assets means that when some lose value, others may gain value. A well-diversified portfolio usually includes a mixture of stocks, fixed income (bonds), and commodities. A diversified portfolio may also include one or more crypto assets, which should also be diversified.

### Double spend problem
The double-spending problem refers to a critical risk with digital currencies where the same funds can be copied and spent more than once. With fiat currency, the spender transfers physical cash to the receiver, unable to spend it again. With digital currency, blockchain systems are devised to prevent a digital token, such as bitcoin, from being sent by more than one address. The risk of double-spending with cryptocurrencies is mitigated by various mechanisms that verify the authenticity of all transactions.

These mass dustings may also be used as stress tests, where a large amount of dust is sent in a short amount of time to test the throughput, or bandwidth, of a network. Some say these dustings are also a way to spam a network, by sending huge batches of worthless transactions that clog and slow it down considerably.

### Epoch
An epoch is a division of time on the Cardano blockchain protocol. Cardano makes use of a proprietary Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros Praos, which divides the blockchain into time-frames called epochs that last approximately 5 days. Epochs are in turn subdivided into smaller increments called slots that last about 20 seconds. There are currently a total of 432,000 slots (5 days) in each epoch. In a specific slot, zero or more block producing nodes may be selected to be the slot leader. Typically, one node is nominated every 20 seconds, totalling over 20,000 slot leaders per epoch. When randomly selected for the role, slot leaders produce blocks, of which one will be added to the blockchain, while other block candidates will be discarded.

### Fork
A fork occurs when one blockchain is divided into two blockchains. This type of split in a blockchain network happens when an update is made to the blockchain protocol, but not all of the network participant nodes agree to adopt it. Blockchains can experience two main types of forks: a soft fork or a hard fork. Soft forks result in an update that is “backwards compatible.” This means that nodes which accept the update are still capable of interacting with nodes which do not. In a hard fork, the update significantly alters the original blockchain protocol such that the two versions are no longer compatible with one another. The result of a hard fork is two unique blockchains that diverge after the hard fork event.

The fees associated with transacting and executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are referred to as gas. Decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain run using smart contracts that lay out rules for execution of events. The execution of events happens through transactions, which come with a cost to the network. These costs are figured based on the computational power required for each action and how long each action operates. Gas costs are denoted in gwei, a denomination of ether (ETH), equal to 0.000000001 ETH. Gas was built into the system to allocate resources to the network of miners who validate transactions and create new blocks. Gas also acts as a spam mitigation tool. By adding a cost to each transaction, nefarious actors who might try to disrupt the system by sending a large number of tiny transactions are deterred from doing so.

GAS is also used to pay for network usage: transaction fees, storage fees, and fees associated with executing smart contracts. All NEO coins were minted at the establishment of the protocol, and GAS coins are minted with every new block.

A hard fork is a software update that is not backwards compatible. In the context of blockchain technology, a hard fork happens when new rules have been introduced into the blockchain code that are not compatible with the rules of the blockchain's previous code. If network nodes do not update their software, they are unable to communicate with nodes that have updated their software. This sometimes results in the blockchain splitting into two networks — one which operates with the old rules and one which operates with the new, updated rules. For example, Bitcoin Cash emerged after a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain.

### Impermanent loss
In Automated Market Makers (AMM) lending providers (LPs) contribute assets for liquidity to market participants. These AMM pools utilize a bonding curve, typically built on a constant function market marker formula. Asset prices are constantly changed by the AMM pool in response to trading activities by participants. This is an effort to ensure that LPs can receive the same amount of assets they deposited when they withdrawal.
However, due to the volatility of asset prices and arbitragers, LPs occasionally will not receive the exact amount of assets upon withdrawal. The dollar value of the assets they withdraw would typically be lower than if they had no provided liquidity and just held the assets. This dollar value shortfall is known as impermanent loss. The loss is said to be impermanent because if asset prices return to the level during withdrawal the loss is eliminated.

Common on exchange trading interfaces, a limit order is a function to buy or sell an asset at a specific price. When a trader sets a buy limit order, they typically set the purchase of the asset to be executed lower than current market price in anticipation of a downward move towards a more favorable price. In contrast, when a trader sets a sell limit order, it is typically set higher than the current market price, in anticipation of the asset going up in value. Specified limit orders can remain unfilled if asset price does not behave in the way anticipated by the trader. By contrast, market orders are always filled at the current trading price of a specified asset without a threshold limit price being set.

Delegates can also transfer the voting responsibilities given to them to another delegate—a process which is referred to as transitivity. If the individual who delegated their vote does not agree with the way their delegate voted, the individual can rescind their vote and vote directly. In LPoS systems, users stake their tokens to earn the right to participate in the blockchain's consensus process, and participate either directly or via a delegate.

Each of the three processes work together to verify data cryptographically and algorithmically in a transparent manner on the Ontology blockchain. Examples of trust anchors can be government agencies, universities, banks, third-party authentication service providers, or biometric technology companies, and constitute a portion of Ontology’s multifaceted trust network — much of which consists of decentralized multi-source authentication protocols.

### Ontorand consensus engine
The Ontology blockchain protocol makes use of the OCE (Ontorand Consensus Engine) consensus mechanism. OCE is an upgraded version of the standardized Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) consensus protocol that also makes use of Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and Proof-of-Stake technology. OCE is based on Onchain’s Distributed Networks Architecture (DNA) which was designed by the creators of NEO. OCE can theoretically achieve near-infinite scalability and requires a relatively low hashing rate, with block-creation speeds limited only by a user’s internet speed.

### Open finance
Open finance refers to the integration of bank and third-party blockchain-based technological applications that are designed to transform the traditional finance sector. Open finance aims to enable financial institutions, large enterprises, and central banks to conduct their business practices in a more transparent, efficient, automated, and data-driven manner. There are three main parameters that must be implemented to facilitate the creation of a resilient and transparent open finance ecosystem. Firstly, to establish a settlement layer consisting of different stable coins; second, to onboard enterprises and construct a data layer to help enable the technology; and lastly, to allow financial institutions to create financial products using trusted enterprise data.

### Optimistic roll-up (or)
An Optimistic Rollup (OR) is a type of roll-up (roll-ups are a specialized blockchain-based settlement process that makes use of smart contracts off-chain) used to lower transaction fees on a blockchain network that processes dApp transactions off-chain before settling the final state on-chain. A sequencer (also called an aggregator) utilizes a fraud proof (essentially a bond) to ensure that the roll-up is processing according to the correct parameters. For this reason, ORs are considered “optimistic,” because they expect sequencers to act in an ethical manner. The fallback mechanism used in this process is the fraud proof, which is used to financially disincentivize malicious actors.

Oracles are third-party information service providers that send external real-world data to a blockchain protocol (often to a smart contract or numerous smart contracts). Oracles give blockchain network protocol’s significantly more power because they are able to exponentially secure, verify, and strengthen the validity of data that a blockchain network receives and makes use of (because blockchains and smart contracts are often closed systems). Oracles can be decentralized and rely on numerous data sets, or centralized and controlled by a single entity. Currently, one of the main uses of blockchain-based oracles is to provide price and data feeds needed for the trustless execution of smart contracts used by financial mechanisms in the DeFi sector.

PoA is a consensus mechanism that leverages the value of identity and reputation instead of cryptographic assets or computational power. PoA relies on a limited number of nodes to verify transactions, and is often criticized for being too centralized. This trade-offis offset by remarkable scalability and transaction speeds.

### Proof of stake
Proof of Stake (PoS) is emerging as one of the most widely used blockchain consensus mechanisms in existence today. PoS networks incentivize participants to stake native tokens in a a network of validator nodes. Upon the close of a transaction block, validator nodes are eligible to be randomly chosen to validate block data, thus generating the subsequent block, and earning native tokens as reward. A robust nodal network offers increased network security, resiliency, and computational power. Proof-of-Stake systems also generally enabe validator nodes to contribute democratically in decentralized platform governance through voting on key updates and decisions. While still a recent innovation, PoS networks are already proving faster and more scalable than Proof-of-Work blockchains, in addition to being more energy efficient.

From there, these stored transactions can then be replaced with another transaction if the sender of that transaction offers to pay a higher transaction fee. As a resut, while RBF can help reduce network congestion and help prioritize transactions in accordance with senders' willingness to pay, the mechanism is somewhat controversial because it alters the immutability of the involved transactions.

### Ring signature
A ring signature is a mechanism that is used to conceal the details of a digital signature in order to hide the specific details of the relevant network transaction. This unique digital signature format can be used by any member of a group of users that is in possession of the correct cryptographic keys. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to determine which group member’s keys were used to produce the signature, which essentially allows the sender of a transaction to remain anonymous and untraceable. The name 'ring signature' is denoted by the ring-like structure of the signature algorithm, and Monero was the first blockchain network protocol to implement ring signatures in 2015.

### Security token offering (sto)
Security Token Offerings (STOs) are a method of distributing security tokens and exist somewhere between Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). To better understand this, it's important to note that security tokens are equity tokens that represent an equity stake in a company or asset, in addition to whatever future returns are associated with partial ownership of that entity, such as dividend payouts. STOs are generally considered superior to ICOs due to the fact that STOs offer instant settlement times, clearer regulatory guidelines, higher liquidity, and a lower barrier to entry in many instances, among other benefits. Since enterprises that create registered securities must adhere to specific compliance and regulatory requirements, STOs avoid a lot of the market ambiguity which ultimately turned many investors off to ICOs, while continuing to offer a straightforward, investor-friendly method of issuing, trading, and storing tokenized equity shares.

### Segregated witness
Segregated Witness (SegWit) is the name of a soft fork that was carried out on the Bitcoin network which changed the transaction format of the protocol. Segwit separates signature data from transaction data within the blockchain to increase the total amount of data within a specific block. By rearranging the data contained in each block more efficiently, more space is freed up which allows for the inclusion of additional data. SegWit is capable of increasing Bitcoin's block size limit from 1MB to 2MB and was designed to mitigate the blockchain size limitation issues that periodically slow down transaction speeds on the Bitcoin network. This is accomplished by "segregating" the transaction into two segments by removing the unlocking signature's "witness" data from the original portion and appending it as a separate structure at the end of the block.

### Sharding
Sharding is a mechanism that is used to partition a blockchain network orother type of computer network or database. Its purpose it to distribute the network's computational and storage workload across a broader set of devices, or nodes, in order to increase the throughput and transaction speed of the entire system. Each node only maintains information related to its specific shard or partition, and since each node is only responsible for processing a fraction of the overall network's transactional load, the network's overall processing capabilities and resilience can be vastly improved. As a result, the increased transaction speeds made possible through sharding have allowed many blockchain-based networks to be exponentially faster, more secure, and better suited for widespread enterprise use.

Sidechains are typically designed to allow for the transfer of data and value between themselves and the mainchain, and oftentimes use a different consensus mechanism than the mainchain. As a result, sidechains can allow for a higher degree of flexibility and scalability, given that systems with a significant sidechain interoperability component are often designed to cater to a broader range of enterprise and individual users.

A cryptographic signature is a mathematical mechanism that allows someone to prove ownership. In the case of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin wallet and its private key(s) are linked by some mathematical magic. When your Bitcoin software signs a transaction with the appropriate private key, the whole network can see that the signature matches the bitcoins being spent. However, there is no way for the world to guess your private key to steal your hard-earned bitcoins.

### Slippage
Within a financial context, slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade relative to the actual price at which the trade is executed. Slippage generally occurs when an investor buys or sells an asset on a platform with poor liquidity and low trading volume. If there is a large gap between the bid-ask price on an exchange's order book, the asset purchaser may end up paying more for an asset or receive less of the asset than expected once the trade has been executed.

In trade, there is almost always a spread between the price that a buyer will pay and the price that a seller will sell an asset. When an order is made, this difference in price between buyer and seller expectations results in price slippage. This slippage in price is usually 1-3% but can be even more for coins with limited liquidity. This slippage can lead to a final sale price of the asset that is either more or less than the requested transaction amount.

### Smart order router (sor)
Smart order routing (SOR) is an automated online trading method which detects and executes the best available trading opportunity throughout a given range of financial markets and trading venues. In essence, when implementing SOR an investor feeds a pre-established set of conditions to a set of bots or algorithms which then scan multiple markets using their given criteria in order to find the optimal environment to execute a given order. Investors typically program the algorithms used to run SOR to differentiate various trading venues in accordance with common parameters such as latency levels, fee structures, and available liquidity, as well as more complex parameters specific to that investor's unique trading strategy. As a result, running SOR requires robust API integrations across different platforms in order to effectively utilize this data-intensive, multiplatform trading strategy.

A stablecoin is an attractive investment to investors because:
-It can be used as a safe harbor or hedge for cryptocurrency funds in times of downward volatility, also known as a bear market, whether this trend in downward volatility is temporary or prolonged in duration.
-It can be used as diversification into the realm of Cryptocurrency finance to take advantage of new products in CeFi and DeFi that are unavailable elsewhere, as a safe diversification into crypto that won't lose nor gain significant value to the stablecoin price.
-A coin with a stable price is used for transferring crypto around, as a means to not lose value in the base asset itself as its being moved around or deployed to Smart Contracts or wallets.

This is accomplished through Synthetix' dual-token model, whereby users stake the platform's main token, Synthetix Network Tokens (SNX), as collateral in order to create new synthetic assets. These 'Synths' are designed to track a metric, usually price, of a real-world asset, thereby allowing users to invest in the asset without actually holding it, much like derivatives. Synthetix preceded Universal Market Access (UMA), which is also built on Ethereum and was launched to achieve a similar purpose.

As a result, 2FA mitigates a variety of cybersecurity risks stemming from both device hacks and human error.

VET holders can increase the VTHO generation rate of their VET coins by placing their coins in different nodes, which are tiered in accordance with their staking requirements. VeChain’s economic model is designed to prevent transaction fees from fluctuating in relation to the price of VET, thus ensuring transaction fee consistency and predictability.

### Verifiable random function (vrf)
A Verifiable Random Function is a cryptographic primitive that was conceived of in 1999 and has many useful applications including deterministic precommitments and having output that is resistant to preimage attacks. In implementation a VRF consists of three related algorithms that do the following:

Key Generation: A mathematical function that when given a random input produces a verification key / secret key pair
Evaluation: This function takes a message and the generated secret key to produce a pseudorandom output, and an associated proof
Verification: This function uses the verification key and other values to guarantee that the output of the Evaluation function could only have been produced by someone who had the associated secret key - all without that secret key ever having to be revealed
VRFs have a wide range of use cases across various cryptographic schemes, protocols, and systems.

### Volatility
Within a marketplace context, volatility refers to the degree of variation an asset's trading prices undergo relative to its mean price over a certain period of time. The more volatile the price of an asset is, the greater the frequency and number of its price changes. This volatility is usually measured using standard deviations of logarithmic returns. Many investors track an asset's volatility in order to identity and capitalize on trading opportunities based on perceived price trends. However, excessive and unpredictable price volatility often deters investors who have a lower risk tolerance.

### Yip
Yearn Improvement Protocol (YIP). Potential YIPs are collaboratively generated by the yEarn Finance community, and are discussed, rejected, or improved upon by YFI token holders and community members providing feedback and suggestions. YIPs are submitted using a certain approved format and method.
Under current governance rules, a quorum of 20% of deposited governance tokens is required to vote on a YIP for it to be considered a valid vote. To pass: a vote on a YIP must have a majority vote of 50%+ of deposited governance tokens voting in favor of the YIP for a YIP to be passed. This democratically community approved YIP is then implemented by multisignature wallet signers in charge of the Smart Contracts behind yEarn Finance

### Yield farming
The manual or automatic lending and/or arbitrage of digital assets to provide an ROI for lending out or depositing digital assets in CeFi or DeFi. Yield Farming can provide an additional income stream over and above any potential increase in the value of an underlying asset. For several reasons - including the ability to make rapid changes, much lower overhead costs, and no regulatory costs - DeFi tends to provide much higher yields when compared to CeFi options.

Yield farming is the practice of staking or locking up cryptocurrencies in order to generate rewards. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) projects rely on yield farming to incentivize users to contribute to the network's liquidity and stability, since these projects do not rely on a centralized market facilitator.

### Yinsure
A new type of insurance was invented by YFI Developer Andre Cronje for crypto-assets and crypto derivatives with underwriting provided by Nexus Mutual. It is a prototype for a new type of tokenized insurance. yInsure tokens are liquidity tokens of various types that allow investors to provide liquidity for crypto insurance pools.
Investors who choose to be Liquidity Providers (LPs) of crypto insurance services are rewarded with a share of initiation fees and weekly fees of customers who have sought the cover or hedge against thefts or hacks of insured digital assets that are offered by yInsure.
Andre explains an innovative aspect of this prototype crypto-insurance:
The design of this system allows any asset that has a financial primitive to be insured, be it a base asset such as DAI, or a composite asset such as aDAI or yDAI.

### Ytoken
A cryptocurrency derivative asset class invented by Developer Andre Cronje, a yToken represents a liquidity token that is given in exchange to an investor's deposit(s). yTokens are used in Yearn Finance products for a variety of uses including lending, insurance liquidity (yInsure), and automated optimized yield farming (yVault).
Examples of yTokens include yCRV, yYFI, and yaLINK. These are primary or secondary crypto derivatives of base crypto assets CRV, YFI and the primary crypto derivative aLINK provided by Aave.
This cryptocurrency derivative asset may also be a second cryptocurrency derivative running a Smart Contract atop another cryptocurrency derivative such as aDAI, an Aave USD liquidity token on Aave.

### Ytokens
yTokens are cryptocurrency derivatives tokens which are awarded to Yearn.Finance liquidity providers (LPs) when they deposit assets into the protocol. Examples of yTokens include yCRV, a derivative of Curve (CRV) and yaLINK, a derivative of Aave's aLINK, which is itself a derivative of the LINK token.

### Yvault
A programmatically adjusted lending aggregator, arbitrageur, and optimized yield farmer. Yearn smart contracts are considered simpler and lower risk than their yVault counterparts. In comparison, yVault smart contracts are considered more complex and higher risk, but in return tend to yield higher ROI.
An example of a complex strategy that can be accomplished by a yVault using a Turing complete program and Smart Contract is the yETH strategy, described as:
Lending - Where assets are lent out via lenders such as Aave, Compound, and dYdX.
Trading - Assets provided to Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve earn trading fees.
Liquidity incentives - Protocols and markets such as Compound, Balancer, and Curve provide liquidity incentives.
By applying the voting power of governance tokens, the power of delegated funds are used to vote for additional incentive rewards for providing liquidity, which can sometimes be reward multipliers for volume users. These multipliers can greatly enhance the ROI of deposited funds.

### Yvaults
yVaults are a feature of the Yearn.Finance protocol which automate the process of yield farming. Users deposit tokens into a yVault, then Yearn borrows stablecoins against the user's asset. The stablecoins are then used for yield farming in various protocols, with the vault shifting strategies as opportunities change. As gains are realized on the stablecoins, Yearn converts the gains back into the user's original asset and the user's rewards are paid in that asset. Each yVault has a different annual percentage yield (APY).

## Z

### Z-addresses
z-addresses are 'shielded,' or privacy enhanced Zcash addresses. Transactions between z-addresses do not reveal the parties' addresses, the transaction amount, or the contents of the transaction's memo field on the blockchain. z-addresses utilize zero-knowledge proofs to achieve these features. z-addresses are interoperable with transparent z-cash addresses, which reveal the transacting parties' addresses, transaction amount, and the contents of the transaction's memo field. Users can therefore send transactions from private address to private address (two z-addresses), from transparent address (t-address) to private address (z-address), or from private address (z-address) to transparent address (t-address).

### Zero knowledge proof roll-up (zkr)
Roll-ups bundle and process smart contract transactions off of the main chain on sidechains before sending them back to the main chain for finalization. A Zero-Knowledge proof Rollup (ZKR) is a type of roll-up which bundles transactions, compresses them, and then attaches a zero-knowledge proof to attest to the state of the sidechain before sending the transactions back to the main chain. While ZKRs are trustless, they require specialized hardware.

### Zero-knowledge proof
Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a cryptographic method that provides users with a higher degree of privacy when engaging in digital transactions. In essence, zero-knowledge proofs enable one party to prove to another party that they know a specific value, without conveying any other information apart from the fact that they know that value. In short, these proofs allow for information to be accurately verified without sharing any details about the underlying information and the identities of the transaction participants.

### Zero-knowledge rollup
A rollup of transactions that use validity proofs to offer increased layer 2 transaction throughput while using the security provided by mainnet (layer 1). Although they can't handle complex transaction types, like Optimistic rollups, they don't have latency issues because transactions are provably valid when submitted.

### Zk-snark
Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) is a type of cryptographic proof used to ensure privacy on blockchain-based distributed ledger systems. It works by proving that one party is in possession of specific data without actually revealing the data to the network by using a secret key before the transaction is broadcasted. zk-SNARKS became prominent with Zcash, Monero, and other privacy-based blockchain protocols.
